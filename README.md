# TypeScript Type Error: Argument of type 'string[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error and its solution. The error arises when attempting to pass an array of strings to a function expecting a single string argument. 

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version.  The solutions include handling array inputs directly or modifying the variable used as an argument.  This example highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript and demonstrates how to resolve type mismatch errors effectively.
